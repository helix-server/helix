# Multiple Middlewares Example

In this example, we demonstrate how to use multiple middlewares in a Helix Server application.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed on your system

## Installation

```bash
bun install
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
bun run serve
```

The server will start and listen on [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080).

🤠 Happy coding!
